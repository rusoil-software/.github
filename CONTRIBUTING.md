# Contributing to Rusoil Software


Thank you for your interest in contributing! Rusoil Software is a nt-run study group and collaborative GitHub organization. All contributions are for **educational and study purposes only**. By contributing you agree to follow these guidelines so we keep the community welcoming and productive.


## Our purpose
- We exist to learn, teach, and practice software development across faculties and study groups.
- This organization is non-commercial — no for-profit activity or donations are accepted unless explicitly approved and documented by the community.


## How to contribute
1. Read the repository `README.md` and `LICENSE`.
2. Check open issues and PRs for related work before starting.
3. If you’re unsure, open an issue or ask in the project’s communication channel.


## Workflow
- Fork the repository (if not a direct collaborator).
- Create a branch with a descriptive name: `feat/short-desc`, `fix/short-desc`, `docs/short-desc`.
- Keep changes small and focused.
- Write tests where applicable and update documentation.
- Open a Pull Request describing what you changed and why.


## Branch & commit conventions
- Branch prefixes: `feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, `docs/`, `refactor/`.
- Commit message style: `type(scope): short description` (e.g., `feat(api): add user search`).
- Sign commits if the repository requires DCO.
